# KasperOnFire - CTF Writeups and solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to different CTFs and wargames i have participated in, either as a team or solo.

Each directory represents a different event or site, and each will contain markdown files with descriptions of solutions, thoughts and other stuff.

The "Tools" directory contains different files used in CTF's, such as lists of most-used passwords.

I do not claim to have any certain skill, and will only use this for personal training.
